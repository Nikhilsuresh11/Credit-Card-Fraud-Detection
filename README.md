## Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

**Problem statement:-**

The aim of the project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. This is crucial from the bank’s as well as customer’s perspective. The banks cannot afford to lose their customers’ money to fraudsters. Every fraud is a loss to the bank as the bank is responsible for the fraud transactions.

The dataset contains transactions made over a period of two days in September 2013 by European credit cardholders. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 8.74% of all transactions. We need to take care of the data imbalance while building the model and come up with the best model by trying various algorithms.

**Steps:-**
The steps are broadly divided into below steps. The sub steps are also listed while we approach each of the steps.
1. Reading, understanding and visualising the data
2. Preparing the data for modelling
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Handling missing values and Skewness
5. Building the model on Imbalanced data
6. Handling Data Imbalance (Oversampling,Undersampling,SMOTE,AdaSyn)
7. Building the model
8. Evaluate the model
9. Choosing the best model
10. Cost Benefit analysis

**Exploratory data analytics (EDA):** Normally, in this step, we need to perform univariate and bivariate analyses of the data, followed by feature transformations, if necessary.However, you can check if there is any skewness in the data and try to mitigate it, as it might cause problems during the model-building phase.

**Train/Test Split:** It involves dividing the data into two parts: the training set and the test set. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate the performance of the model.

**Model Building:** It involves creating a mathematical representation of a real-world phenomenon or process that can be used to make accurate predictions about new, unseen data. The goal of model building is to find a model that best captures the relationships between the input variables and the target variable in the training data.

**Model Evaluation:** We need to evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Note that since the data is imbalanced it is is more important to identify which are fraudulent transactions accurately than the non-fraudulent. We need to choose an appropriate evaluation metric which reflects this business goal.
